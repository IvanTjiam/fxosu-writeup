This project was requested by Mozilla, specifically the team working on Firefox OS. Our customer during the course of our project was Dietrich Ayala, a Project Manager working on Firefox OS and a member of the Mozilla family since February 2006. Dietrich's role in our project took many forms, and evolved as what we needed did so. Initially, he helped on board us to the Firefox OS platform, providing us with plenty of documentation to wrap our heads around, and once we have devoured this information, he was quick to setup meeting with members form the Firefox OS networking team. Throughout the year Dietrich was always available via IRC, Skype, Email, and Cell, whenever we needed him. And if he could not answer a question for us, he knew who could.
\\\\
The members of our team were John Zeller, Pok Yan Tjiam, and Jonathan McNeil. John Zeller, having worked with Mozilla for over a year as an intern and contractor, acted as a de facto team lead during the course of the project. Pok Yan Tjiam worked on \_\_\_. Jonathan McNeil worked on \_\_\_.
\\\\
The purpose of this project was to help work towards giving developers a tool that allows them to avoid the typical environment agnostic network request paradigm. As it currently stands, most developers create apps with little to no information about the quality of the network. In their apps, they typically run network requests in a dumb loop, which simply tries continually until the request succeeds. This is wasteful in terms of both battery and data, and overloads an often times already overloaded network.
\\\\
Firefox OS is not a direct competitor to the well known giants in the mobile OS space, but is aimed at being a good solution for the next 4 billion people coming online; the majority of which are coming online in developing countries where network infrastructure is literally decades behind, having a profoundly negative impact on user experience. In many cases poor network conditions can even render some applications non-functional. Aside from out-dated networks, some areas of these developing countries also have unreliable electrical grids, which can make charging a phone take days for many users living with the most unreliable grids. And this problem is only growing worse, at an ever growing pace. In the next 30 days, India alone is expected to account for 5 million new internet users.

\section{What did we learn from all of this?}
\subsection{John Zeller}
\textbf{What technical information did you learn?}\\
I learned a lot about JavaScript. When I first began working on this project, I came in with the urge to do and learn something outside of my comfort zone. I usually write in Python, and have primarily used Python in the 3 internships that I have had. So, writing JavaScript, and moreover, becoming aquanted with Firefox source code were both amazing learning experiences.
\\\\
Digging into the Firefox source code gave me a much better idea of how a browser is put together. Understanding the complexities of a relatively small part of Firefox, such as IPC, has given me a great insight into the complexity of this code base.
\\\\
\textbf{What non-technical information did you learn?}\\
I learned more about the organization of teams within Mozilla, and the separation of efforts in one product, accross multiple teams. There really is a huge amount of institutional knowledge, and a lot of it has been written out in their wiki pages. I also learned that a lot of those wiki pages are out of date, and need some love.
\\\\
\textbf{What have you learned about project work?}\\
I learned a lot about the importance of a design cycle such as Agile. Most of the senior design process is sort of intrinsically setup in a Waterfall design cycle, but you are free to iterate on that, running your own weekly, bi-weekly, monthly etc. Agile cycles. Our group in particular ran into this pretty hard, and we ended up changing 10 of our 24 requirements. When we originally wrote our requirements document during Fall term, we had an idea of what the project would look like, and not 4 weeks later, that idea changed significantly.
\\\\
\textbf{What have you learned about project management?}\\
Other than the importance of design cycles, as I mentioned above, I learned about the importance of constant communication with your project customer. It's very possible that the ideas you have begun to spin within your own mind, and in the hive mind of the project group, could be wildly different, or even slightly misaligned from that of the project customer, and the much larger hive mind of your customers organization.
\\\\
\textbf{What have you learned about working in teams?}\\
I've certainly learned about the importance of communication throughout the project. Often we would run into issues where one or more of our group members were lost, while perhaps at least one knew the way forward. Clear communication and clearing up questions is something that produces a well oiled machine.
\\\\
\textbf{If you could do it all over, what would you do differently?}\\
If I could do it all over again, I would spend significantly more time researching our project during October, before our requirements document was written. If we were able to have overcome many of the changes that we needed to make later on, this would have seriously increased the ease of implementation that we experienced throughout the project.
