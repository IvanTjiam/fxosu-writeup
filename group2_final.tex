This project was requested by Mozilla, specifically the team working on Firefox OS. Our customer during the course of our project was Dietrich Ayala, a Project Manager working on Firefox OS and a member of the Mozilla family since February 2006. Dietrich's role in our project took many forms, and evolved as what we needed did so. Initially, he helped on board us to the Firefox OS platform, providing us with plenty of documentation to wrap our heads around, and once we have devoured this information, he was quick to setup meeting with members form the Firefox OS networking team. Throughout the year Dietrich was always available via IRC, Skype, Email, and Cell, whenever we needed him. And if he could not answer a question for us, he knew who could.
\\\\
The members of our team were John Zeller, Pok Yan Tjiam, and Jonathan McNeil. John Zeller, having worked with Mozilla for over a year as an intern and contractor, acted as a de facto team lead during the course of the project. Pok Yan Tjiam worked on \_\_\_. Jonathan McNeil worked on \_\_\_.
\\\\
The purpose of this project was to help work towards giving developers a tool that allows them to avoid the typical environment agnostic network request paradigm. As it currently stands, most developers create apps with little to no information about the quality of the network. In their apps, they typically run network requests in a dumb loop, which simply tries continually until the request succeeds. This is wasteful in terms of both battery and data, and overloads an often times already overloaded network.
\\\\
Firefox OS is not a direct competitor to the well known giants in the mobile OS space, but is aimed at being a good solution for the next 4 billion people coming online; the majority of which are coming online in developing countries where network infrastructure is literally decades behind, having a profoundly negative impact on user experience. In many cases poor network conditions can even render some applications non-functional. Aside from out-dated networks, some areas of these developing countries also have unreliable electrical grids, which can make charging a phone take days for many users living with the most unreliable grids. And this problem is only growing worse, at an ever growing pace. In the next 30 days, India alone is expected to account for 5 million new internet users.
