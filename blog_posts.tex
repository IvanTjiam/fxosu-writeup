Fall 2014, Week 5: \\

Plans for coming week: \\
- Start working on the requirements documemt \\
- Continues to research on Firefox OS \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Problem statement finished \\
- Technology review finished \\
- Project blog and project site set up \\
- Problem statement and technology review uploaded to the project site \\

This week we set up our project blog and project site using Sharepoint space. The project site is used to store and share documents we made such as the problem statement and technology review to the whole team. The project blog is used to keep track of our progress on this project. We posted our progress updates on the project blog every week so that our client can know what we are currently working on. \\

Fall 2014, Week 6: \\

Plans for coming week: \\
- Continues to work on the requirements document \\
- Continues research (necko), get familiar with Web IDL specifications \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Finished the basic structure of the requirements document \\

We expect to finish the introduction and project description parts of the requirements document, and think of some requirements for this project in the next week. We create our first draft of the requirement document in Word format instead of LaTeX because it is easier for us to edit it online. We stored our requirement document on Google Drive and shared it to the whole team as well as our client so that every one in our team can work on the document at the same time. Also, our client can give us immediate feedback without sending email but simply add a line somewhere on the document. We followed the format provided in the assignment page and finished the basic structure of the requirements document at the end of this week. \\

Fall 2014, Week 7: \\

Plans for coming week: \\
- Continues to work on the requirements document \\
- Finish the requirment parts of the requirements document \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Finished the introduction part of the requirements document \\

We continue to work on the requirement document in this week. We combined the words FxOS and OSU to FxOSU and decided to use it as our team name. Our progress on the requirement document was pretty slow because we have to do more research on Firefox OS at the same time. At the end of this week we finished the introduction part of the requirements document and filled in some requirements of the project. \\

- Finish the whole requirements document \\
- Get the requirements document signed \\
- start working at the poster \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Finished the project description part of the requirements document \\

This week we were still working on the requirement document. We were a bit behind schedule and need to finish the requirement document as soon as possible in order to get feedback from our client and get it signed before Thanksgiving. \\

Fall 2014, Week 9: \\

Plans for coming week: \\
- Finish the poster \\
- Start working on the preliminary design document \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Requirements document finished and submited \\
- Requirements document uploaded to the project site \\
- Start working on the poster \\

Finally we finished the requirements document and got it signed. The requirements document was also uploaded to the project site. We felt like we have a problem on our time management. To prevent similar thing happens, we need to check each otherâ€™s schedule and have more time to work together. \\

Fall 2014, Week 10: \\

Plans for coming week: \\
- Finish the preliminary design document \\
- Finish the progress report \\
- Meet with Professor McGrath for end-of-term meeting \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Preliminary Poster finsihed \\
- Preliminary Poster uploaded to the project site \\

This week we started working on the poster that we will be using in the Expo and got it finished in this week. Since this is only a preliminary design of the poster, we did not fill in all the contents. The poster have a blue background and orange header and it follows the Firefox OS branding guidelines. \\

Two of our member, John and Jonathan, went to Portland to meet with our client and engineers from Mozilla. We have a more clear direction on what we are going to do. \\

Fall 2014, Finals week: \\

Plans for the next term: \\
- Working on the Javascript prototype \\
- Research on Services Worker \\
- Research on RequestSync \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Preliminary design document finished \\
- Progress report finished \\

This term we spent most of the time working on documents and research. Next term we will start working on the prototype of our API. and we will later move on to the implementation in C++. \\

This week is the end of Fall term. The blog will stop updating until next term. \\

Winter 2015, Week 1: \\

Plans for coming week: \\
- Start working on the actual implementation \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Set up the weekly meeting with our TA \\
- Set up our group meeting time \\
- Requirements updated \\

Winter term begins and we get back to our project. In the first week, we scheduled a weekly meeting with our TA. and updated the requirements. We broke down our project into 24 requirements and each member handle 8 of them. We are expected to complete 6 requirements at the end of this term and 2 for the next term. \\

Winter 2015, Week 2: \\

Plans for coming week: \\
- Start working on the prototype API \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Updated requirements approved \\
- Requirements completion list submitted \\

This week we got our new requirements approved and divided works to each member. We also started our implementation of prototype API using JavaScript. \\

Winter 2015, Week 3: \\

Plans for coming week: \\
- Working on the prototype API \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Updated requirements approved \\

Again we update one of the requirement to make it more specific and got it approved. After speaking with our sponsor, we decided to implement our prototype API as a Firefox addon instead of putting it into the Firefox core, while the  C++ API will still need to be put into the core. \\

Winter 2015, Week 4: \\

Plans for coming week: \\
- Finish the implementation of the prototype API \\
- Finish the first 9 requirements and get ready for demo \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Created a draft of the prototype API \\

This week we were working on the prototype API. Because our API will communicate between C++ and Javascript, we implement our prototype API as a XPCOM component. We succesfully installed the prototype API as an addon to the Firefox but we failed to call the C++ function in Javascript. We will keep working on it and try to make the addon works in the next week. \\

Winter 2015, Week 5: \\

Plans for coming week: \\
- Finish the implementation of the prototype API \\
- Test the prototype API on desktop, Android and Firefox OS \\
- Demo the prototype API to the TA \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Implemented the prototype API addon using addon SDK \\
- Battery level, device charging state and network latency data are accessible from the prototype API \\

This week we were still working on the prototype API. Since the addon-via-manifest prototype API does not works well, we tried another method and implemented the addon via SDK. Also, it turns out that some of the functionality of our API are only available on the Firefox OS but not the desktop version. Therefore we need to write a new prototype for the Firefox OS device. \\

Winter 2015, Week 6: \\

Plans for coming week: \\
- Start working on the actual API using C++ or Javascript \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Prototype API finished \\
- Completed the demo of first 9 requirements to the TA \\

This week we finally finished the prototype API. The prototype can detect the battery level, charging state of the device, network connection type and shows latency-related information. We also changed our requirements after talking to the sponsor to scope the prototype down so that we have more time to focus on the actual API. \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Start working on the actual API using C++ or Javascript \\

This week we keep on working on the API. A few weeks before we got a developer reference phone called Flame from our sponsor. We began testing our API on this Firefox OS device to make sure our API works on all platform of Firefox. \\

Plans for coming week: \\
- Continue working on the API using C++ or Javascript \\

Progress since last week: \\
- Continue working on the API using C++ or Javascript \\

This week we are still working on the API. Most of the functions of the actual API are same as the prototype API. Some of the new functions of the actual API include collect network status information, access system load information and to integrate with existing API such as ServiceWorker and RequestSync. Each of our group member take charge of one of these function. \\
